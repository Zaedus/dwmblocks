# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

## Scripts

The scripts needed for my build are in the scripts directory of this repo, but they should be put in the `~/.dwm/scripts/` directory on your computer.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Zaedus/dwmblocks
cd dwmblocks
sudo make clean install
```

It should be that simple!
